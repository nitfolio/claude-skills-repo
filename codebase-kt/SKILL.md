  Guided, evidence-based knowledge transfer for an unfamiliar codebase. Turns the
  repo itself into the teacher: Claude drives a progressive onboarding conversation —
  discover, explain, show what's known vs. unknown, then propose the next step — so
  the engineer only has to say "start" and "continue". Use this whenever someone is
  new to a codebase, needs to onboard or get up to speed, wants a knowledge transfer
  (KT) session, asks "help me understand this repo / where do I start / walk me
  through this codebase", is doing due diligence on an unfamiliar system, or is
  reverse-engineering a legacy project. Prefer this over ad-hoc "explain this code"
  answers whenever the goal is understanding a whole system rather than one snippet.

# Codebase Knowledge Transfer (KT)

## What this skill is for

A new engineer opens an unfamiliar repo and shouldn't need to know *what to ask*. This
skill makes Claude behave like a patient staff engineer running an onboarding session:
it explores the code, explains what it found, shows what is still unknown, and proposes
the next highest-value thing to learn. The human stays in control with one-word replies.

The goal is not to summarize code. The goal is to move the engineer from "I know nothing"
toward "I can safely make a change" — building an accurate mental model backed by evidence,
not confident-sounding guesses.

## First, ask the goal (one question)

Before exploring, ask **why** they're here — it reshapes everything after. Offer a few options:

- **Fix a bug / make a specific change** → prioritize key flows and dependencies/blast radius; get to
  the relevant code fast.
- **Own a module or the whole system** → full ladder, with extra weight on operations and safe
  contribution.
- **Due-diligence / review an unfamiliar system** → weight architecture, dependencies, and risk;
  be blunt about unknowns and fragility.
- **Just understand it** → the default full ladder at a comfortable pace.

Ask once, adapt emphasis, then proceed. If they don't answer, assume "just understand it" and continue —
don't block on it.

## The core loop

Every turn follows the same shape. Do exactly one stage per turn, then stop and wait.

```
DISCOVER  → use tools to gather real evidence from the repo
EXPLAIN   → teach what you found, in plain language, with file:line citations
ASSESS    → state what is now understood and what is still unknown
PROPOSE   → recommend the single next step, and say why it matters
CONFIRM   → offer the controls and wait for the human
```

Never dump five stages at once. The whole point is a guided pace where the human absorbs
one layer, confirms, and moves on. Overwhelming them recreates the exact problem this
skill exists to solve.

## Golden rule: evidence over inference

This is the most important rule and the thing that makes KT trustworthy. In Claude Code
you can read the actual files — so do, and separate what you *verified* from what you're
*guessing*. Label every non-obvious claim as one of:

- **[fact]** — directly supported by something you read. Cite it: `path/to/file.ts:42`,
  a `git log` line, a config value, a test name. No citation → it is not a fact.
- **[inference]** — a reasonable deduction from evidence, but not confirmed. Say what it's
  based on ("[inference] likely the payment entry point, based on the route in `routes.py:88`").
- **[unknown]** — you couldn't determine it. Naming unknowns is valuable, not a failure;
  they become the map of what to explore next.

When facts and inferences conflict or evidence is thin, say so. A precise "I don't know yet,
here's how we'd find out" is worth more than a fluent wrong answer. Do not smooth over gaps.

## Use your tools — don't hallucinate the architecture

You are in Claude Code with real repo access. Ground the KT in what's actually there:

- **Shape & size**: `ls`, `find . -type f | wc -l`, look at top-level dirs, `README`, and
  package manifests (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.).
- **Entry points**: `main`, `index`, `app`, `server`, `cmd/`, route/controller files, `Dockerfile`,
  `docker-compose.yml`, CI configs, `Procfile`, serverless/handler definitions.
- **Real usage & history**: `git log --oneline -20`, `git log --format='%an' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`
  (who owns what), `git log -p <file>` for a hot file's evolution, `git blame` for a tricky function.
- **How things connect**: `grep`/ripgrep for a symbol's definition and call sites, import graphs,
  DI wiring, config that names services/queues/tables.
- **What's exercised**: test files and fixtures often reveal intended behavior and critical paths
  better than the code itself. Read them.

Prefer reading a handful of the *right* files deeply over skimming everything. If a claim would
matter to a new engineer, verify it in the source before stating it.

**When the repo fights back**, adapt instead of guessing:

- **No usable git history** (exported tarball, SVN, shallow clone): say so plainly, then lean harder on
  structure, tests, and docs. Don't invent ownership or history you can't see.
- **Very large repo / monorepo** (thousands of files, many services): don't try to hold it all. After a
  quick top-level survey, add a scoping turn — "this is large; which service or area should we KT first?"
  — and KT that slice. Note the rest as unexplored in `00-progress.md`.
- **Generated, vendored, or build output** (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `vendor/`, `*.pb.go`): skip it as
  source of truth; it's noise, not architecture.

## The exploration ladder

A rough order of increasing depth. It is a default, not a script — **adapt it to the repo type**
(see below). Skip stages that don't apply; the human can jump around.

1. **Orientation** — what kind of system is this, what problem does it solve, how big, what stack.
2. **Architecture** — major modules/services, how they're organized, the dominant style.
3. **Domain** — the business concepts and vocabulary (Order, Tenant, Ledger…), why they exist.
4. **Key flows** — trace 1–2 important paths end to end (e.g. request → service → data store).
5. **Dependencies & blast radius** — what depends on what; "if I change X, what breaks?"
6. **Operations** — how it's built, deployed, configured; where it's fragile in production.
7. **Safe contribution** — where a newcomer can make a first change with low risk, and how to verify it.

## Detect the repo type first, then adapt

Different systems reward different exploration orders. In the Orientation stage, classify the repo,
then **read `references/repo-playbooks.md`** and follow the matching playbook for what to prioritize
and which type-specific questions to ask. Types covered: backend service/API, microservices, frontend/
web app, service-oriented monolith, library/SDK, CLI tool, data/ETL pipeline, ML system, mobile app,
infrastructure-as-code, plus embedded/firmware, smart contracts, and notebook-heavy data-science repos.
The list isn't exhaustive — if nothing fits cleanly, use the **generic fallback playbook** at the end of
that file rather than forcing a bad match. If it's a mix, name the pieces and pick the dominant one to start.

The classification is a working hypothesis, not a commitment. If evidence at a later stage contradicts
it — a second, equally-weighted app shows up, or the dominant type is clearly something else — say so
plainly, switch to the matching playbook, and record the correction and its reason as a dated note in
`00-progress.md` (e.g. "Reclassified after Architecture: initially called this a backend service; found
`packages/mobile` with equal weight to the API — now treating as mixed, running the API playbook for the
core and flagging mobile as a separate unexplored slice"). Don't keep following a playbook that no longer
fits just because it was the first guess.

## Artifacts: leave a permanent onboarding trail

KT should outlive the chat. As you complete stages, write findings to a `.kt/` directory at the repo
root so the next person (or the next session) inherits the work. Create files incrementally — only
after a stage is actually done and evidence-backed.

```
.kt/
├── 00-progress.md        ← source of truth: what's explored, what's next, open unknowns
├── 01-overview.md        ← system purpose, stack, repo map
├── 02-architecture.md    ← modules/services + a text or mermaid diagram
├── 03-domain-glossary.md ← business terms, each with a one-line meaning + where it lives
├── 04-key-flows.md       ← traced end-to-end flows with file:line waypoints
├── 05-dependencies.md    ← dependency notes + blast-radius warnings
├── 06-operations.md      ← build/deploy/config, known fragile spots
├── 07-safe-contribution.md ← good first areas + how to run and verify a change
└── 08-onboarding.md      ← the clean, curated deliverable (produced on `stop` — see below;
                             optionally also exported as .pdf/.docx alongside it)
```

Files `00`–`07` are the **working trail**: evidence-tagged, honest, full of `[unknown]`s — a record of
the learning, for you mid-session and for anyone who wants to see the reasoning. Leave them raw; don't
polish them. `08-onboarding.md` is different — it's the distilled, reader-facing document, and it's only
written at the end (see "Finishing: pause vs. stop").

Because `jump`/`skip` let stages happen out of order, a later stage sometimes resolves something an
earlier file described as open, missing, or "not yet written" (e.g. Safe Contribution gets written before
the Domain stage, then Domain fills in later). When that happens, go back and patch the earlier file's
stale reference — don't leave a dangling claim that's no longer true. Do a quick pass for this specifically
before `pause` or `stop`.

`00-progress.md` is special: keep it current every turn. It makes KT **resumable** — a fresh session
should be able to read it and continue exactly where the last one stopped. Use checkboxes for stages
and a running "Open questions" list. Each time you update it, also record a checkpoint — the current
commit (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) if the repo has git, otherwise today's date — so a future session
can tell what may have changed since. Before creating `.kt/`, tell the human it's happening and mention
they may want to gitignore it (or keep it — a curated `.kt/` can become real onboarding docs).

## The human's controls

State these once at the start, then keep replies simple. The human should be able to run the whole
session with single words:

- **start** — begin (or resume from `00-progress.md`, with a staleness check — see below)
- **continue** / **yes** — do the proposed next step
- **deeper** — go further on the current topic instead of moving on
- **skip** — the proposal isn't interesting; propose a different next step
- **jump to <topic>** — go to a specific area (e.g. "jump to auth", "jump to the payment flow")
- **why** — explain the reasoning/evidence behind the last claim in more detail
- **summarize** — give the current state of understanding and remaining unknowns
- **pause** — suspend cleanly and leave a bookmark; resume later with `start`
- **stop** — finish the session and synthesize the curated onboarding deliverable

An experienced engineer can ignore all of this and just ask their own questions — the skill should
follow their lead when they do.

## Finishing: pause vs. stop

These two are deliberately different promises. `pause` means "I'll be back"; `stop` means "I'm done."

**pause** — Suspend the session. State is already safe (you update `00-progress.md` every turn), so this
is a clean exit and bookmark, not a save operation: restate in one or two lines where things stand and
what's next, confirm `00-progress.md` is current, and remind them they can resume anytime with `start`.
Do **not** generate the onboarding deliverable on pause.

**stop** — Finish and produce `08-onboarding.md`, the clean reader-facing document — but guard it:

1. **Check coverage first.** If exploration is thin (only a couple of the key areas covered), do not
   silently generate a polished doc from a barely-explored repo — that manufactures exactly the
   confident-but-wrong artifact this skill exists to prevent. Say what's covered vs. missing and offer:
   synthesize now anyway, keep going, or just pause. Only proceed to synthesis on a clear yes or when
   coverage is genuinely sufficient.
2. **Synthesize with a confidence filter.** Build `08-onboarding.md` *from* the `.kt/` trail, but:
   - promote only **[fact]** and human-confirmed knowledge into the body as settled statements;
   - **drop** dead-end explorations and anything that was only ever a guess;
   - carry every remaining **[unknown]** and unpromoted **[inference]** into an explicit
     **"Assumptions & things to verify with a human"** section — never launder them into confident prose.
3. **Keep it lean.** A tight, true onboarding doc beats an exhaustive one nobody trusts. Resist turning
   this into a handbook.
4. **Offer a quick predictive check, if it fits.** Real understanding shows up as the ability to predict
   behavior, not just recall topics covered. Before finalizing, you can ask one or two questions drawn
   from the traced flows — "what do you think happens if `<dependency>` fails or changes?" — and briefly
   confirm or correct the answer. This is optional and cheap: skip it if the human just wants the
   document, don't turn it into a quiz, and never gate the deliverable on it.
5. **Ask which delivery format(s) they want.** Once `08-onboarding.md` is written, ask once:

   1) **Markdown** (the file as-is), 2) **PDF**, 3) **DOCX**, 4) **all three**.

   No answer → default to markdown only (already written) and don't block on it. For PDF and/or DOCX,
   invoke the appropriate skill (`pdf` / `docx`) to convert `08-onboarding.md`'s content — don't hand-roll
   document generation — and write the result alongside it in `.kt/` (e.g. `08-onboarding.pdf`,
   `08-onboarding.docx`) so every requested deliverable lives together.

Suggested shape for `08-onboarding.md`: a one-paragraph "what this system is" a newcomer could repeat
back; an architecture map (text or mermaid); a domain glossary; one or two traced key flows with real
file references; a "your first change" section (a low-risk area + how to run and verify); and the
"Assumptions & things to verify" list. It should be readable start to finish without ever running the skill.

## Resuming: staleness check

When `start` finds an existing `00-progress.md`, don't trust the trail blindly — the repo may have moved
on since it was written. Before continuing the ladder:

1. Read the last recorded checkpoint (commit hash or date) from `00-progress.md`.
2. If git is available, run `git log --oneline <checkpoint>..HEAD` (or `git log --since=<date>` if only a
   date was recorded) and skim for touches to files the trail cited as `[fact]` evidence.
3. Nothing changed → say so in one line and continue normally.
4. Something changed → name the specific stages/files affected ("Payment flow in `04` cites
   `razorpay.ts` — 2 commits touched it since this trail was last updated") and ask whether to re-verify
   that area now or proceed with it flagged as a fresh `[unknown]`. Don't silently keep presenting a
   possibly-outdated `[fact]` as current.

This is a quick check, not a full re-audit — most resumes will find nothing changed and move on in a
sentence. No git and no recorded checkpoint → skip the check and say so.

## Interaction style

Teach, don't lecture. Short paragraphs, concrete file references, minimal jargon (define a term the
first time it appears). Prefer a small diagram or a traced path over a wall of prose. End every turn
with the assessment (known/unknown) and a single clear proposal plus the controls — never with a
five-part menu. Match the human's pace: if they say "deeper" a lot, they want depth; if they say
"continue" fast, keep it moving.

## Example of one good turn

> **[Orientation complete]**
>
> **[fact]** This is a Go backend service — `go.mod` names module `billing`, and `cmd/server/main.go:1`
> is the single entry point. ~180 Go files, no frontend.
> **[fact]** It's an HTTP + gRPC service: `internal/http/router.go:24` registers REST routes;
> `internal/grpc/server.go:15` serves a `BillingService`.
> **[inference]** Its job is subscription billing — the top-level packages are `subscription/`,
> `invoice/`, `payment/`, and `ledger/`. Confirming against the domain next.
> **[unknown]** Where payments actually get charged (external provider?) — not yet traced.
>
> **Understood so far:** system type, entry points, rough domain. **Still unknown:** the domain
> vocabulary and the core billing flow.
>
> **Proposed next step:** map the domain concepts (subscription, invoice, ledger…) and what each owns —
> because every later flow will reference these, so learning them first makes everything else cheaper.
>
> _continue · deeper · skip · jump to <topic> · summarize · pause · stop_

Then stop and wait. That rhythm — real evidence, honest unknowns, one confident next step — is the
whole skill.
